Why did Israel really attack Iran? Analysis with wit included.

Israel’s recent strikes on Iran mark a dramatic escalation in a decades-long shadow war that’s finally emerged from 
the shadows – rather like a pensioner suddenly taking up parkour. The reasons behind this attack weave together 
existential threats, geopolitical manoeuvring, domestic politics, and enough ideological hostility to make a North 
London dinner party look tame. Below, we dissect the key drivers – from nuclear paranoia to Netanyahu’s increasingly 
creative approaches to job retention.

## The nuclear threat: Israel’s existential fear  

Israel views Iran’s nuclear programme with the same enthusiasm one might reserve for finding a spider in one’s breakfast cereal – as an immediate and existential danger. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been sounding the alarm for years with the persistence of a malfunctioning smoke detector. Israeli intelligence claims Iran is "weeks rather than months" away from weaponisation, prompting strikes on enrichment facilities like Natanz and Fordow – because nothing says "diplomacy" like precision munitions.  

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), meanwhile, maintains there’s no evidence Iran is building a weapon, creating that special brand of international tension where everyone’s reading different intelligence reports over their morning coffee. Whether Israel knows something we don’t or is simply engaging in particularly aggressive preventive housekeeping, the attack may have achieved the opposite of its intent – pushing Iran closer to the nuclear threshold while providing splendid target practice for Tehran’s missile crews.  

## Geopolitical chess: Decapitating the "axis of resistance"  

Iran isn’t just Israel’s nuclear bogeyman – it’s the ringleader of a regional network of proxies that makes the mafia look disorganised. Israel’s strikes took out key figures like IRGC commander Hossein Salami and nuclear scientist Fereydoon Abbasi, because nothing disrupts an axis of resistance quite like removing its axis.  

This isn’t merely defensive – it’s Netanyahu playing Middle East Jenga, carefully removing pieces while hoping the whole structure doesn’t collapse onto his head. With Hezbollah’s leadership already diminished by previous Israeli strikes, the gamble is that Tehran will respond with all the ferocity of a strongly worded letter – or that the Americans will clean up any mess that ensues.  

## Netanyahu’s political survival: Wagging the dog with explosives  

Let’s address the elephant in the room – or rather, the politician in the bunker. Netanyahu is Israel’s longest-serving PM, clinging to power with the tenacity of a limpet and facing more legal challenges than a law student’s final exams. The October 2023 Hamas attacks rather spoiled his carefully cultivated "security strongman" image, leaving him in need of a dramatic reset – enter Operation Rising Lion.  

By framing the strikes as essential self-defence, Netanyahu achieves two goals: distracting from his domestic troubles and uniting a fractious public against an external threat. It’s the political equivalent of setting your own house on fire to distract from unpaid bills – dramatic, certainly effective in the short term, but with obvious long-term drawbacks.  

## Regional and global fallout: Oil, alliances, and the spectre of war  

The strikes have sent shockwaves through global markets and alliances, proving once again that the Middle East excels at turning localised disputes into everyone’s problem.  

### Oil markets in turmoil: From price spike to economic cardiac arrest  

The immediate 7-9% surge in oil prices provided traders with their daily adrenaline rush, with Brent crude hitting highs not seen since March 2022. The Strait of Hormuz – that vital artery through which 20% of global oil flows – now sits in the crosshairs, though Iran faces the classic villain’s dilemma: blockading it would annoy both the Americans and their Chinese business partners.  

For now, Tehran seems content with missile strikes rather than economic suicide, but the situation remains as stable as a house of cards in a breeze. Should Saudi Arabia and the UAE get dragged in, we may see OPEC+ attempting to stabilise markets while quietly wishing everyone would just calm down.  

### Alliances shift: The diplomatic equivalent of musical chairs  

The US finds itself in the awkward position of having to support Israel while pretending it wasn’t consulted about the strikes – a diplomatic tightrope walk made more precarious by an election looming like an awkward family gathering. President Trump must balance backing Netanyahu against avoiding petrol price spikes that could make voters as cheerful as a British summer.  

Meanwhile, Russia and China are exploiting the situation with the subtlety of a sledgehammer at a tea party. Moscow reaffirms support for Tehran while Beijing carefully calculates how much chaos benefits its position. Gulf states publicly condemn Israel while continuing intelligence sharing – the international relations equivalent of complaining about your neighbour while still borrowing their lawnmower.  

### The spectre of war: From bad to catastrophic  

Iran’s initial missile retaliation achieved little beyond giving Israel’s missile defence systems some target practice, but the regime has promised a "painful and bitter" response – which could mean anything from proxy attacks to nuclear brinkmanship.  

Potential escalation paths include:  
- Hezbollah and the Houthis launching attacks with whatever resources they have left after years of conflict  
- Iran deciding that if everyone thinks they want a bomb, they might as well build one properly  
- Economic collapse in Iran potentially destabilising the regime or making it more dangerous  

The UN Security Council’s calls for restraint are about as effective as a paper umbrella in a monsoon, with Russia and China shielding Iran while the West backs Israel. Should full-scale war erupt, the consequences could make the Ukraine conflict look like a minor diplomatic misunderstanding.  

## Conclusion: A high-stakes gamble with no winners  

Israel’s attack combines genuine security concerns with strategic opportunism and political theatre – the Middle Eastern equivalent of juggling chainsaws while riding a unicycle. Whether it delays Iran’s nuclear ambitions or accelerates them remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the region just became even more volatile, proving that when it comes to Middle Eastern geopolitics, things can always get worse.  

For now, the world watches with the nervous anticipation of spectators at a fireworks factory fire – hoping for containment but preparing for spectacular disaster. The next moves by all parties will determine whether this becomes another managed crisis or the spark that ignites something far worse.
