Poverty isn’t just a lack of money—it’s a meticulously engineered trap ([done mostly by “developed” countries](https://gitlab.com/tymyrddin/nerrin/-/tree/main/notebooks/poverty)). While the so-called "developed" world pats itself on the back for occasional charitable gestures, billions remain ensnared in systems designed to keep them poor, hungry, and powerless. The bitter irony? The very countries lamenting global poverty are often the ones perpetuating it through exploitation, climate destruction, and a stubborn refusal to address root causes.

### Hunger: The self-perpetuating crisis

Undernourishment isn’t merely a symptom of poverty—it’s a generational curse. A malnourished mother gives birth to a child already at a disadvantage: weakened immune systems, stunted growth, and cognitive impairments that echo through a lifetime. These children struggle in school, earn less as adults, and are more likely to develop chronic illnesses, ensuring the cycle continues. And let’s not pretend this is some natural phenomenon. Climate change—driven overwhelmingly by the carbon excesses of wealthy nations—worsens droughts and floods, decimating crops and displacing populations. Hunger breeds desperation, and desperation breeds conflict. But of course, when the bombs drop, it’s the poor who die first.

### Isolation: The invisible cage

Poverty thrives in isolation—geographic, social, and economic. Remote villages with no roads, no schools, no hospitals are left to rot, while women and minorities are systematically excluded from opportunity under the guise of "tradition" or "religion." No infrastructure means no escape. No education means no upward mobility. And no voice means no one in power has to care.

### Infrastructure: The broken ladder

The equation is simple: no infrastructure, no way out. Roads, clean water, healthcare, and schools are the bare minimum for a functioning society, yet they remain out of reach for millions. Early warning systems could save lives from disasters, but why invest in prevention when you can exploit the aftermath? Gender equality could lift entire communities, but patriarchal structures ensure women stay trapped in unpaid labour. Education could break the cycle of poverty, but when children must work to survive, classrooms stay empty.

And let’s not forget the grand hypocrisy of "aid." Western nations love to swoop in with their pre-packaged solutions—dropping food instead of funding sustainable agriculture, building schools without training teachers, donating medicines while pharmaceutical companies price-gouge. The most effective way to help? Ask people what they actually need. But that would require listening, and listening doesn’t make headlines.

### Resource theft: The global land grab

While corporations and wealthy nations hoard fertile land, mines, and fisheries, traditional livelihoods vanish. Climate change accelerates the crisis, rendering once-fertile regions barren. The result? Millions forced into slums, sweatshops, or dangerous migration routes—all while the same corporations that stole their resources profit from their desperation.

### Resilience without a safety net

For the poor, disaster doesn’t mean inconvenience—it means ruin. No savings, no insurance, no food reserves. When crisis hits, families are forced to sell the little they have, including, in the worst cases, their own children. Adoption, prostitution, forced marriage—these are not choices, but survival strategies in a world that has abandoned them.

### The unspoken truth

Poverty isn’t an accident. It’s the inevitable result of a global system built on extraction and inequality. The rich world’s comfort depends on the poor world’s suffering. Until that changes, no amount of charity or half-measures will fix what was designed to be broken.
