In *The Hunger Games*, twenty-four children are forced to kill each other while the elites applaud. It was sold as 
dystopian fiction. The trouble is, [it is looking more like current affairs with every passing news 
cycle]({{< relref "posts/hunger-games.md" >}}). The real world, too, is structured like a zero-sum game, where one 
person's gain is another's loss. There are no mutual wins here, only trade-offs, casualties, and very profitable illusions.

This article contends that global power operates not unlike the Capitol’s arena: a ritualised battleground in which 
marginalised regions, Gaza, the Congo, Yemen, Ukraine, are sacrificed to maintain the illusion of order and the comfort 
of hegemony. The names change. The rules do not.

## Zero-sum mechanics in *The Hunger Games*

Let us begin with the game’s structure. 
[The Capitol]({{< relref "posts/hunger-games/#the-capitol-where-the-party-never-ends-and-accountability-never-begins" >}}) 
hoards everything, resources, weapons, even the narrative, while the 
districts are left to starve, scrabble, and applaud their own destruction. Violence becomes theatre. Public punishment 
becomes prime-time entertainment. And the tributes? They are not merely victims; they are trained collaborators. Career 
tributes emerge as the privileged enforcers of the system that will eventually discard them.

The parallels are not exactly subtle. 
[Gaza is District 14 in all but name]({{< relref "posts/hunger-games/#district-14---gaza-and-the-occupied-territories" >}}), boxed in, bombed out, and reduced to a 
siege economy. Every airstrike becomes a viral video. Human suffering is edited down into clips suitable for 
dinner-time viewing. Ukraine, meanwhile, has become a heavily armed tribute, sacrificed on the altar of geopolitical 
spectacle. Whether the profits flow to Washington, Brussels, or Moscow hardly matters; the dead are always local.

## Real-world arenas: zero-sum politics

Move past the metaphors, and the mechanics remain. The Congo holds over 80 percent of the world's cobalt supply, 
essential for phones, laptops, electric cars. And yet, miners there often work in conditions best described as 
pre-industrial hellscapes. These are literal blood minerals, extracted for the comfort of those who would rather not 
ask where their batteries come from.

Data, too, has become a form of tribute. The poor hand over their privacy for the illusion of digital survival. 
One signs up for free services; in return, they are monitored, measured, and monetised. It is not so much surveillance 
capitalism as digital feudalism, serfs trading data for relevance.

Then there is the old imperial standby: divide and conquer. The sponsors of modern conflict are not always hiding. 
The United States and Europe have mastered the art of funding both sides. Israel and Palestine. India and Pakistan. 
It makes one wonder whether peace is simply bad for business. The media, of course, play their part. While famines 
unfold, one is offered royal gossip and celebrity scandal. The Gamemakers have learned to distract the masses with 
a steady drip of irrelevance.

## Breaking the game: is non-zero-sum possible?

Hope, like Katniss herself, tends to appear when least expected. There are rebellion strategies, even now. Mutual 
aid networks in Gaza, for instance, operate as quiet acts of resistance, communal kitchens feeding people where 
governments fail. Elsewhere, boycott movements, divestment campaigns, and whistleblowers like Snowden attempt to 
sabotage the spectacle. These are not revolutions in the Hollywood sense. They are quieter, and far harder to market. 
But they matter.

Still, the system has its limits. Foreign aid, that noble-sounding concept, often functions more like a debt trap. 
Loans from the IMF come with austerity strings attached, liberalise this, privatise that, sell your future for spare 
change.

And what of those who *win*? Ukraine, for example, may yet be welcomed into NATO, only to discover that victory comes 
with reconstruction bills, lost territory, and a traumatised generation. The Victor’s Curse is very real: even the 
"successful" emerge maimed.

To turn a zero-sum game around from the bottom up, stop playing by its rules. This is not about asking 
the gamemakers for a kinder arena.

### Refuse the premise

The first step is recognising the game for what it is. A zero-sum setup insists that your gain becomes someone else's 
loss. The trick is to step outside that framing. This is not wishful thinking, it is strategic deviance. Cooperatives, 
commons-based economies, and mutual aid networks work precisely because they do not play the scarcity script.

No one wins when everyone hoards. Unless, of course, your victory condition is everyone else’s ruin. But most of 
us are not hedge funds or defence contractors.

### Build horizontal

Top-down revolutions tend to replace one elite with another. The game simply resets with new jerseys. The alternative 
is horizontal organisation: local food sovereignty, community-run infrastructure, cooperative tech platforms. 
These do not need permission from a centralised authority; they just need people to stop waiting and start connecting.

Build networks that *cannot* be bought off or decapitated. [Think funghi]({{< relref "posts/fungolia.md" >}}), not monarchs.

### Disrupt extraction

If the Capitol runs on blood minerals, rent-seeking, and data mining, then interruption is power. This can mean 
civil disobedience, or subtler forms of sabotage (e.g. privacy tools, data poisoning, supply chain resilience built 
from below). The point is to choke off the flow of value from periphery to core.

You are not supposed to notice that you are the product. Noticing is step one. Redirecting is step two.

### Reclaim narrative

Gamemakers thrive on distraction. Every celebrity scandal is another smokescreen. Every crisis without context is 
another spectacle. Reclaiming the story means making space for inconvenient truths, structural analysis, and 
remembering who benefits.

This is not about "raising awareness" into the void. It is about using language and story to unmask the game, to 
make it visible, and therefore, breakable.

### Make the invisible visible

Zero-sum games depend on keeping the scoreboard hidden. Who pays the price for your phone? Who cleans the water 
for your city? Who dies so that supply chains remain ‘resilient’? The less visible the sacrifices, the easier they 
are to justify.

Making visible does not fix the game, but it puts the lie to it. And a game with broken rules is one fewer people are 
willing to play.

### Practice refusal

Participation is not neutral. Opting out of parts of the game, where possible, is more than symbolic. It slows the 
machine. Whether it is refusing surveillance tech, rejecting exploitative contracts, or simply declining to be 
productive for an economy that extracts more than it returns, each act of refusal makes space for another way.

You do not have to win the Hunger Games. You do not even have to play.

### Solidarity, not sympathy

Feel-good campaigns come and go, but solidarity builds power. It means shared risk, not charitable pity. It means 
standing *with*, not speaking *for*. When Palestinians, Congolese, or Indigenous communities fight extraction, they 
are not asking for your tears. They are asking whether you will block the bulldozer, refuse the contract, pull 
your data (and financial investments) out of the mine.

### Final word

You will not fix the game by winning it. You can fix it by not playing their game all the time, and playing our own 
non-zero-sum games as much as we can.

The Capitol, ultimately, is not a city. It is a mindset, complacent, self-righteous, and allergic to consequences. 
The games only continue because we keep watching. The tributes only die because we keep betting on them.

The Capitol does not fall in one grand gesture. It withers as more people stop feeding it, stop trading humanity 
for proximity to power, stop applauding the spectacle, stop betting on tributes.

When Katniss shot the force field, she proved that even the most rigged game depends on players. Refuse the spectacle. 
Stop choosing sides in a game designed to break them both.
