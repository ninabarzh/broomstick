[If Donald Trump is the political Trickster]({{< relref "posts/trump-as-trickster.md" >}}) — chaotic, comic, and morally confused — then Vladimir Putin is his mirror opposite: the Tyrant King, sat frozen on the throne. Less Coyote, more Koschei the Deathless. If Trump breaks rules loudly for laughs, Putin bends them in silence, eyes fixed on history’s long game and a map of empire that never quite vanished.

To understand Putin is to confront a different archetypal beast altogether. This is not the jester’s theatre. This is the chill of the northern archetype: the shadow sovereign who rules through fear, paralysis, and myth.

### The king on the medicine wheel

In Indigenous traditions — particularly those of North America’s Plains cultures — the Medicine Wheel offers a framework for understanding balance in human behaviour, leadership, and society. Each direction on the wheel corresponds to a set of traits, life stages, and responsibilities. The North holds the archetype of the King or Chief: the Elder, the Wise One, the figure who carries vision, responsibility, and the burden of stewardship.

The healthy Northern archetype is one of maturity and deep time: someone who thinks in generations, protects the community, and leads not with charisma but with calm authority. It is the seat of legacy, of considered judgment, of the long view.

But when power is hoarded, and fear overrides wisdom, the King becomes petrified. This is the shadow of the North: the Tyrant King. Obsessed with order, allergic to change, and incapable of letting go. Instead of leading from experience, he rules from paranoia. Instead of passing the torch, he smothers the flame.

### Frozen sovereignty

Vladimir Putin embodies the Tyrant King almost too perfectly. He presents himself as the guarantor of stability, the man who rescued Russia from the chaos of the 1990s. His mythology is built on control: control over territory, over narrative, over dissent.

His personal brand is constructed for permanence. Judo black belt. Hunter. Horseback statesman. Defender of tradition. Yet beneath this spectacle is a model of governance that prioritises system-freezing over system-repair. He doesn’t modernise institutions; he turns them into shadows of themselves. Parliament exists, but votes are stage-managed. Opposition parties exist, but only under strict supervision. Elections happen, but the result is rarely in doubt.

In this world, Putin is not merely President. He is the centre of gravity. Remove him, and the state structure threatens to implode — not because it was strong, but because it was hollowed out to depend on him entirely.

### The magician’s mask

Putin’s formative years in the KGB taught him that power lives in opacity. Unlike loud demagogues, he operates in the murk: careful, indirect, and deliberate. This places him partly in the realm of the shadow Magician archetype — not the playful conjuror, but the manipulator of symbols, the engineer of perception.

He doesn’t need to lie outright. He just creates enough parallel narratives that truth becomes a matter of preference. State media is less propaganda and more reality-distortion field. Alternative histories flourish. Internal contradictions are features, not bugs. A war can be a "special operation." Dissent can be "foreign interference."

This shadow magician doesn’t sow chaos for reform, but for fatigue. The goal isn’t to inspire rebellion or even loyalty. The goal is to exhaust the capacity to resist.

### Permanent war, permanent rule

Where the true King archetype blesses his people with peace, the Tyrant King sustains himself on conflict. Putin’s rule is marked by a long series of military interventions: Chechnya, Georgia, Crimea, Syria, Ukraine. Each packaged as a righteous defence of Russian identity, a necessary response to NATO, a bulwark against historical erasure.

But these aren’t wars in the traditional sense. They are geopolitical theatre: rituals of power designed to reinforce internal unity through external aggression. The enemy is always close, always shifting, always convenient. Peace is never fully achieved because peace invites scrutiny. And scrutiny is lethal to myths.

This is not strategic miscalculation. It is ideological necessity. The war must continue so the rule may remain.

### The deathless one

Russian folklore gives us Koschei the Deathless: a skeletal, sorcerous figure who cannot be killed because his soul is hidden inside a needle, inside an egg, inside a duck, inside a chest, buried under a tree. He hoards power and life itself, living in isolation and dread.

Koschei is not a hero. He is not even alive in the usual sense. He is undead power, parasitic on the world around him. And in Putin, this archetype finds modern expression. His soul is buried in layers of narrative and bureaucracy, nested within fear, preserved by ritual and repression.

No heir is groomed. No future is imagined. Only the endless present, curated by a man who believes that letting go is equivalent to annihilation. His rule isn’t just about longevity — it’s about denying time itself.

### What he exposes

Archetypes are not just stories. They are diagnostic tools. They reveal the inner logic of systems. If Trump exposed how democracies can become theatre, Putin shows what happens when power becomes ossified — when institutions are drained of substance and turned into mirrors for one man’s continuity.

He reminds us that systems don’t fall apart with a bang. Sometimes they just stop breathing. And as long as fear remains stronger than curiosity, as long as stability is defined as obedience, the Tyrant archetype remains not just a ruler, but a warning.

### Conclusion: the cold north and the cracked wheel

When the Northern archetype falls into shadow, the rest of the Medicine Wheel suffers. The South — creativity, play, new beginnings — is stifled. The East — vision, logic, clarity — becomes ideological and rigid. The West — emotion, reflection — turns into numbness.

Putin, as the Tyrant in the North, locks the wheel in place. Nothing moves. And so Russia drifts not into chaos, but into stasis. The system isn’t failing. It is precisely calibrated to do nothing but preserve itself.

This is not leadership. It is enclosure. And like all enclosures, it will eventually crack — whether from within or without.

And in that silence, someone else will pick up the wheel and try to turn it again.
