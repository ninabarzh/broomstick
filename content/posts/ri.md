Far-right movements thrive in the shadows, weaving complex networks across borders that shape politics and media 
narratives. Reactionary International steps into that murky terrain with a public, evidence-based approach, mapping 
these hidden connections for all to see. Rather than conspiracy or propaganda, it offers rigorous research from a 
diverse team of contributors worldwide. Exploring the project’s origins, funding realities, and why it 
stands apart from typical disinformation claims.

## A public lens on hidden networks

Reactionary International is an openly accessible research platform published by Progressive International, whose 
[About page](https://reactionary.international/about/en/) clearly describes its creation and mission. Its stated aim 
is to trace the links between politicians, think‑tanks, media outlets, financiers, journalists and technology 
platforms involved in far‑right coordination and influence campaigns.

## Who is behind the project

Reactionary International operates under the umbrella of Progressive International, a coalition founded in May 2020 
to coordinate democratic and progressive movements around the world. Its launch opened with an investigation into 
[Modi, the BJP and how they are connected internationally](https://progressive.international/wire/2024-04-19-pi-briefing-no-16-in-india-and-beyond-meet-the-reactionary-international/en).

Progressive International publicly affirms that it receives no government grants or public funding, instead relying 
entirely on donations from its individual and organisational members.

Different researchers contribute to different investigations, drawn from across the globe and including academics, 
journalists and civil society actors. The [About section](https://reactionary.international/about/en/) on Reactionary 
International outlines the consortium’s structure, partner organisations and thematic scope, assuring transparency 
in both authorship and intent.

## How the research is done

[Although not named OSINT](https://shadowdragon.io/blog/osint-techniques/), 
investigators use open‑source intelligence techniques to base their work entirely on publicly available documents, 
official records or reputable media reports.

Case studies generally include citations to original media, legal documents or other verifiable sources, allowing 
readers to trace each claim independently. The research method also includes triangulation of multiple independent 
sources to minimise bias and strengthen factual accuracy.

## Why it is not propaganda

Propaganda tools typically obscure sourcing, present one-sided narratives, and discourage critical examination, none 
of which is congruent with Reactionary International’s openly archived case studies and transparent methodology.

Instead, the platform invites readers to inspect data, re‑trace connections, and build upon its findings in 
independent analysis or reporting.

The platform has been visibly featured and referenced by progressive media such as [Common Dreams](https://www.commondreams.org) 
and [Convergence Magazine](https://convergencemag.com/), an openness wholly inconsistent with a secretive 
“shadow site” model.

## Funding and financial transparency

Progressive International explicitly states on [its support page](https://progressive.international/support/) that it 
does not accept public or government funding and operates solely on member donations.

Reactionary International is funded via general contributions to Progressive International rather than having a 
standalone grant structure, and sometimes runs modest public appeals for specific investigative reports.

There is no publicly disclosed evidence that Reactionary International receives direct corporate, foundation, or 
governmental funding outside of those member-based or collaborative contributions.

## Impact and reception

Since its public launch in April 2024, Reactionary International has published extensively on topics including 
[India’s BJP and the Hindutva network](https://reactionary.international/cases/global-hindutva/en/), 
[“Team Jorge” hacker operations](https://reactionary.international/investigations/disinformation-industry/en/), 
[Turkey’s Grey Wolves](https://reactionary.international/cases/turkey/en/), 
[Falun Gong media networks](https://reactionary.international/cases/immolations-extraterrestrials-and-anti-communism-the-falun-gong/en/), 
[Spain’s far-right movement](https://reactionary.international/cases/spain/en/), and more. A veritable treasure trove 
of verified and factual information.

Its investigations follow on the investigative traditions of 
[OSINT pioneers like Bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/articles/2016/07/14/a-brief-history-of-open-source-intelligence/), 
whose forensic analyses of global events, from [MH17](https://www.wired.com/story/iran-plane-crash-news/) to war-crime 
accountability, demonstrate how public-source evidence can powerfully challenge disinformation.

Its research has been cited or used by academic experts on extremism, civic watchdog organisations, and independent 
journalists investigating political and digital influence networks.

## How to explore and use the platform

Reactionary International is free to use and allows exploration of case studies, downloadable maps of interlinked 
actors, and source documentation.

Journalists can draw leads and corroborated facts; educators can integrate case studies into political science or 
media literacy curricula; activists and researchers can use the data to support transparency campaigns or peer research.

## The case for open investigation

When critics invoke labels like “propaganda” or “shadow site”, transparency remains the strongest rebuttal, and 
Reactionary International’s open methodology, global contributor pool, and public funding appeals embody that 
principle.

By making all claims traceable, inviting external validation and enabling use of its data by anyone, the 
platform strengthens the information ecosystem against secrecy, manipulation and disinformation.

Readers and researchers who engage with the material can independently verify findings, follow investigative threads, 
and support a more informed public discourse, underscoring that openness, not propaganda, is the core of the project.
