## Trump the trickster: the joke that ran for president

Donald J. Trump — property mogul, reality TV star, political wrecking ball — is many things. But viewed through the mythic lens of the **[trickster]({{< relref "posts/trickster.md" >}})**, he becomes oddly legible. Like Anansi, Loki, or Hermes after too much Adderall, Trump doesn’t simply break rules — he points at them, mocks them, and sells merch off the wreckage. He is not the fool. He is the **dealer of foolishness**, and he’s made the world play.

Tricksters don’t succeed because they’re right. They succeed because they change the terms of the game. And Trump did just that — not by rising above the absurdity of American politics, but by embodying it so completely that the absurdity could no longer be ignored.

## What tricksters *do* — and how Trump fits

Traditional tricksters have a few signature moves:

1. **They break taboos** — not just to offend, but to test the limits of social order.
2. **They expose hypocrisy** — by acting it out with such enthusiasm that it becomes unbearable.
3. **They weaponise laughter** — undermining authority through ridicule, parody, and sheer audacity.
4. **They bend identity** — shifting roles (god/fool, leader/buffoon) until categories collapse.

Now watch Trump:

* Breaks every taboo of political discourse — from insulting war heroes to mocking disabled journalists.
* Uses language not to clarify but to disorient — “I never said that”, “people are saying”, “I know more than the generals.”
* Turns political debate into WWE theatre, complete with nicknames, beefs, and spectacle.
* Performs sincerity and irony simultaneously — was he serious about bleach injections? Does it matter?

He is a figure who **destroys semantic stability**, which is *exactly* what the trickster does.

## The trick he exposes

If every trickster reveals the lie at the heart of their society, what lies did Trump pull into the spotlight?

- **That the grown-ups are in charge.**
- That institutions are sacred.
- That "decorum" is the same as competence.
- That politics is a realm of reasoned discourse.

Trump didn’t invent the rot — he just **made it look funny** (while causing tremendous harm). He showed that media obsession trumps policy, that outrage generates clicks, and that fact-checking is powerless against performance. He turned the press into a laugh track and cable news into a feeding tube. His rallies were trickster rituals: call-and-response satire, red hats and snake oil, truth and untruth dancing in full view.

Where previous politicians maintained the illusion of unity and legitimacy, Trump **exposed the theatre**. He didn't drain the swamp — he grabbed the camera and filmed a reality show *inside* it.

## Trickster — but whose?

Unlike Hermes or Coyote, Trump’s trickster energy is not necessarily in service of the people. Traditional tricksters often restore balance by challenging hierarchy. Trump **replicates** hierarchy while pretending to subvert it. He mocks [elites]({{< relref "posts/elites-myth.md" >}}) while being one. He bashes the system while gaming it. He's the trickster in the palace — not on the road.

This is why he’s both compelling and dangerous. He offers the performance of resistance, not its reality. Like a meme that feels transgressive but sells T-shirts, his rebellion is always *just enough* to provoke — never enough to liberate.

## Conclusion: a carnival mirror

Trump is not the trickster America wanted. But perhaps he is the one it deserved — a walking, tweeting funhouse mirror reflecting the culture back at itself: absurd, bombastic, obsessed with image, allergic to nuance.

And in that sense, he’s done what tricksters have always done:

* He’s made it impossible to keep pretending.
* He’s turned the system inside out and revealed its laughable entrails.
* He’s made the lie so big, so loud, so orange, that we finally had to see it.

**The joke isn’t just on us — it *is* us.** And sadly, it is costing a lot of lives ...
