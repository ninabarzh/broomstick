Picture a journalist, a scientist, or even your neighbour, declaring solemnly: *"I am being objective."* The words sound dignified, don’t they? Objective, impartial, fact-driven—like a well-polished broom sweeping all bias into the corner. And yet, beneath the polished surface, the broom often only sweeps in the direction that maintains the existing hierarchy.

Objectivity is frequently presented as a moral or intellectual shield, a way of claiming distance from messy human feelings, politics, or ethical dilemmas. But claiming objectivity is not a neutral act. Like neutrality, it carries consequences: it frequently protects those already in power and silences the vulnerable.

I argue that objectivity, in practice, is rarely pure. By examining historical cases, moral reasoning, and contemporary examples, it becomes clear that “objective” perspectives are always framed by context, power, and perspective.

## Science and the illusion of neutrality

Consider the 19th-century eugenics movement. Scientists and statisticians presented “objective” findings about human intelligence and heredity. Numbers, charts, and tables gave an air of irrefutable neutrality. Yet these “objective” conclusions were used to justify sterilisation, segregation, and discriminatory laws, disproportionately harming marginalized communities.

The key lesson: presenting conclusions as objective does not make them morally neutral. The veneer of objectivity lent authority to policies that were anything but ethical. When historical context and power imbalances are ignored, objectivity becomes a weapon for the already powerful.

## The moral and philosophical argument

Philosophers and ethicists have long noted the limitations of pure objectivity.

* Hannah Arendt warned that detachment without moral awareness can lead to complicity, famously analysing how bureaucratic “just following orders” logic enabled atrocities during the Holocaust.
* Sandra Harding and other feminist theorists critique “objectivity” as often reflecting the perspective of dominant groups, masking social biases as neutral facts.

From these perspectives, objectivity is less a universal truth than a reflection of who gets to define what counts as “neutral.” Claiming objectivity often functions as a polite way of saying: *"I will report the facts that do not inconvenience me or those in power."*

## The illusion of balance

### False equivalence as objectivity

Modern media frequently invokes objectivity to justify presenting “both sides” of a debate, even when one side is demonstrably harmful or false. Consider climate change denial: giving equal airtime to a handful of contrarians alongside overwhelming scientific consensus creates an illusion of balance. Neutrality masquerading as objectivity misleads the audience while appearing fair-minded.

### Numbers without context

Algorithmic “objectivity” is another modern trap. Credit scoring, predictive policing, and hiring algorithms often claim to be objective because they use data and statistics. Yet these systems inherit societal biases encoded in historical data. Claiming objectivity allows companies and institutions to deny responsibility when the results disproportionately harm marginalized communities.

### Gatekeeping disguised as neutrality

Even in scholarly settings, objectivity can serve as a gatekeeping tool. Decisions about whose research is “rigorous” or “credible” are frequently influenced by social and cultural norms. Scholars from marginalized groups often face additional scrutiny under the guise of methodological rigor, while mainstream perspectives glide past criticism under the protective cloak of objectivity.

## Objectivity is not a neutral force

Objectivity is a useful tool—but only if wielded with awareness of context, power, and impact. Without this, it becomes a shield for the already powerful and a weapon against those without privilege. Like neutrality, claiming objectivity does not absolve moral responsibility.

Rejecting the myth of objective impartiality does not mean abandoning reason; it means acknowledging perspective, context, and the consequences of one’s choices. In short, objectivity is not an inherent virtue. It is only as ethical as the person—or institution—claiming it.
