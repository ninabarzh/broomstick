## About the Broomstick

Welcome to *The Broomstick Brief*—a blog for those who suspect that the world isn’t quite as rational, peaceful, or 
democratic as advertised.

This is a space for untangling complexity, lifting the curtain on technocratic waffle, and occasionally poking polite 
fun at the collapsing scaffolding of late-stage capitalism. Here you’ll find long-form analysis, speculative scenarios, 
and the odd broom closet of critical thought—sweeping through the mess of geopolitics, information warfare, climate 
collapse, digital security, and the bureaucratic inertia that enables it all.

We take Europe seriously enough to critique it, and power seriously enough to mock it. From BRICS+ fantasies to 
flotilla voyages, economic sieges to surveillance sleight-of-hand, each post aims to shift the Overton window ever 
so slightly off its hinges.

This is not a blog for the faint of heart, nor for those seeking five-point solutions to thousand-year problems. 
But if you're partial to: threads of resistance hidden in footnotes, the politics of infrastructure and broken links, 
or the occasional ASCII diagram of societal decay—Then you’re in the right place.

### Who’s behind the broom?

A systems tinkerer, threat modeller, and critical educator with a habit of tracing root causes where others would 
rather prune symptoms. More comfortable in the command line than on a podium, but willing to write the things that 
ought to be said—especially when they’re inconvenient.

Having returned home after 20 years, having had the time to research things (curiosity and the drive for grounding 
always makes time), and hardly having had time for writing, I seem to be exploding in bottled up rants.

All views are the author's own. Which is to say: fiercely independent, fact-grounded, and allergic to buzzwords 
unless used ironically.
