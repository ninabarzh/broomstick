Since 2012, over two thousand environmental defenders have been killed globally for the simple act of standing up to 
those who would destroy their land, water, and communities. In 2023 alone, 196 defenders were killed, with Colombia 
leading at 79 deaths, followed by Brazil (25), Mexico (18), and Honduras (18). Indigenous peoples, who make up 
just 6% of the global population, accounted for 43% of these victims. This isn't a coincidence; it is a systemic 
crisis fueled by corporate greed, organized crime, armed groups, and state complicity.

## Corporate exploitation and targeted violence

Corporations in mining, logging, and agribusiness are at the heart of many of these conflicts. They encroach 
upon Indigenous territories and protected areas to extract resources, and when communities resist, violence often 
follows.

In Honduras, the 
[2024 assassination of Juan López](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/09/honduras-murder-environmentalist-juan-lopez-criminalisation) 
underscored this deadly entanglement. López had been campaigning against an iron oxide mining project, which involved 
companies like Inversiones Los Pinares and Inversiones Ecotek, notorious for environmental violations. His death was 
not an isolated incident but a symptom of how corporate interests can intersect with local political corruption to 
create a lethal environment for activists.

[PBI Canada reports](https://pbicanada.org/2025/09/17/global-witness-report-18-killings-and-one-disappearance-of-land-and-environmental-defenders-in-mexico-in-2024): 
In Mexico's Chiapas region, similar patterns emerged. Carmen López Lugo, an Indigenous environmental activist, was 
murdered in 2024 amid territorial disputes over resource-rich lands. The conflict in Chiapas illustrates how 
corporate interests, criminal organizations, and local power struggles converge to endanger defenders. Mining 
remains the deadliest industry for environmental activists, and opposition to such projects in Colombia, Brazil, and 
Mexico consistently makes Indigenous and peasant leaders prime targets.

## Armed groups and organised crime

Violence against environmental defenders is not limited to corporate action. Armed groups and organized crime 
syndicates often exploit the same resource-rich territories.

In Colombia, despite peace agreements with FARC, dissident armed factions continue to dominate regions rich in 
minerals and agricultural resources. [These groups target activists opposing their control](https://www.genocidewatch.com/single-post/more-than-350-environmental-activists-killed-in-colombia-since-2018), ensuring both 
territorial dominance and financial gain.

In Venezuela, the Uwottüja Indigenous community along the Orinoco Medio River faced violent incursions from 
dissident FARC elements and the National Liberation Army (ELN) in search of precious metals. 
Virgilio Trujillo Arana, a local community guard who resisted these incursions, was murdered in 2022. 
[These cases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jul/07/venezuela-indigenous-leader-killed-amazon-defenders)
demonstrate that environmental activism in such regions intersects directly with organized crime, creating a 
landscape where defenders are constantly at risk.

## State complicity and impunity

Adding another layer of danger, state actors—sometimes through action, often through inaction—enable violence 
against defenders. In Honduras, the murder of Berta Cáceres in 2016, an activist opposing the Agua Zarca Dam, 
exposed how corporate projects can operate with military and political backing. Similarly, in Mexico, 
Carmen López Lugo was killed by perpetrators using military-grade weapons, showing how state resources may become 
instruments of terror, reports [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/05/honduras-imperative-state-guarantee-truth-justice-reparation-family-berta-caceres).

Even with international frameworks like [the Escazú Agreement](https://www.cepal.org/en/escazuagreement), designed 
to protect environmental defenders in Latin America, slow ratification and weak enforcement leave many exposed. 
Impunity is endemic: perpetrators operate with minimal fear of consequences, emboldened by the structural failures 
of legal and political systems.

## A lethal ecosystem

These forces—corporations, criminal organisations, armed groups, and state actors—function within a mutually 
reinforcing ecosystem. Corporations depend on armed groups to secure territories. Criminal organisations profit from 
resource extraction. State actors may turn a blind eye or directly support these operations. The result is a perilous 
landscape in which environmental defenders are attacked from multiple directions.

This ecosystem thrives on resource competition, criminalization of activism, and impunity. Communities who resist 
exploitation are not only challenging profit-driven interests but also confronting an intricate web of violence 
where multiple actors have aligned incentives to silence them.

## Conclusion

The deaths of environmental defenders are neither random nor isolated. They reveal a global system in which 
corporate greed, criminality, armed power, and political complicity converge to make environmental protection a 
dangerous act. Indigenous and local communities are disproportionately affected, yet international protections 
remain fragile. To prevent further deaths, there is a need for robust legal frameworks, corporate accountability, 
international pressure, and unwavering support for those standing at the frontlines. Environmental advocacy should 
never be a death sentence—but without systemic change, the lethal cost of defending our planet will continue to climb.
