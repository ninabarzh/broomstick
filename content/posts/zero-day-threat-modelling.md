Threat modelling for zero-day vulnerabilities is a peculiar exercise in preparing for the unknowable. These are not the comfortable, catalogue‑ready bugs that live in CVE databases. These are the ones nobody—least of all the vendor—has seen fit to admit exist. They arrive without warning, without a patch, and with precisely zero days’ notice before being exploited. The task, therefore, is less about ticking boxes and more about building the sort of resilience that can withstand the unexpected without falling to pieces.

## Understanding zero-day vulnerabilities in threat modelling

A zero-day vulnerability is a flaw in software that the vendor does not yet know about and, consequently, has not patched. It might lurk in your operating system, your applications, your firmware, or the cloud services you have so enthusiastically embraced.

Traditional threat modelling often leans heavily on known‑vulnerability databases and predictable attack patterns. Unfortunately, zero‑days are absent from these lists by definition. Modelling them requires a shift from reactive to proactive thinking: rather than plotting where you know the enemy might come from, you must look for the paths you have not yet mapped.

## Key methodologies for zero-day threat modelling

### STRIDE framework adaptation

If you are using the STRIDE methodology—Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, 
Elevation of privilege—it still has its uses, but it needs a nudge towards the hypothetical. Instead of matching 
threats to known bugs, focus on architectural weaknesses. Examine trust boundaries with a cold eye for where an 
unknown flaw might slip through. Follow your data flows until you find the dark corners where a payload could be 
injected. Map out possible privilege‑escalation routes that could be abused by a flaw no one has yet documented. 
Microsoft recommends applying STRIDE to data flow diagrams to make this sort of thinking systematic, though it is 
still something of an art (being diplomatic here).

### PASTA (process for attack simulation and threat analysis)

PASTA OTOH, with its seven‑stage, risk‑focused approach, is well‑suited to the problem. It starts with defining 
objectives, which in this context means identifying the assets most attractive to anyone who might stumble 
across a zero‑day. Then you map your architecture, decompose it into parts, and start asking awkward questions 
about where the weak points might be hiding.

For example, for an Industrial control system (ICS) network:

* Define objectives: Maintain operational continuity and safety for a water treatment plant.
* Map architecture: Diagram PLCs, SCADA servers, historian databases, operator HMIs, engineering workstations, and external vendor remote access points.
* Decompose: Identify firmware versions, network segments, and dependency on vendor software.
* Awkward questions:
  * Could a zero‑day in a PLC firmware allow unauthorised commands that alter chlorine dosing?
  * Could a flaw in the remote access VPN client provide an attacker with a foothold inside the OT network?

Or, for a SaaS platform:

* Define objectives: Protect multi‑tenant data integrity and confidentiality.
* Map architecture: Diagram the load balancers, application servers, Kubernetes clusters, object storage, and identity provider integrations.
* Decompose: Break down each service, container image, API, and shared library.
* Awkward questions:

  * Could a zero‑day in the Kubernetes API server enable privilege escalation across namespaces?
  * Could a flaw in a widely‑used open source library give an attacker remote code execution on all customer environments?

From there, simulate how an attacker might discover and exploit the unknown. Use tools such as fuzz testing to 
shake loose flaws you did not expect. Model how these might be weaponised, then weigh the risks according to 
their potential impact and plausibility. It is meticulous, occasionally tedious work, but then so is clearing 
unexploded ordnance.

### Attack trees

Attack trees offer a visual way to think through the improbable. Start with the attacker’s ultimate goal as your 
root node—say, exfiltrating customer data. Branch out into possible routes, including the use of a zero‑day. Keep 
branching until you reach the leaf nodes, which represent specific techniques such as memory corruption or 
bypassing input validation. This is a way to think about how the unknown might be combined with the known to 
create a credible attack chain.

## Proactive strategies for zero-day threat modelling

### Assume breach mindset

Operating on the assumption that a breach has already occurred changes the conversation. Instead of fixating solely on prevention, you plan for containment and swift recovery. You model post‑exploit scenarios, decide how you would isolate the damage, and ensure your monitoring is alert for behaviour that does not belong.

### Behaviour-based analysis

With no handy signature to spot, you have to know what “normal” looks like for your systems and applications, and watch for deviations. This involves building baselines, then using runtime protection tools to spot suspicious execution patterns. It is digital pattern recognition with a healthy dose of paranoia.

### Attack surface reduction

The fewer doors you have, the fewer can be forced open. Disable services and features you do not use. Apply the principle of least privilege religiously. Use micro‑segmentation so that any breach is boxed in. And always, always validate and sanitise inputs—everywhere.

### Threat intelligence integration

You may not know the exact shape of the next zero‑day, but you can watch for its shadows. Monitor vulnerability‑research communities, track attacker tactics and techniques, and study the history of zero‑days in systems like your own. Better still, participate in information‑sharing networks. You might learn something useful before it turns up in your logs.

## Implementation best practices

### Secure development lifecycle integration

Threat modelling for zero‑days should not be bolted on at the end. At the design stage, architect systems with resistance to unknown flaws in mind. In development, stick to secure coding practices and use static analysis. In testing, add fuzzing and dynamic analysis to catch the things you did not expect. At deployment, layer in runtime protections that will not wait for a patch before acting.

### Zero trust principles

Zero trust architecture, when done properly, reduces the blast radius of a zero‑day. Verify every access request. Limit lateral movement so one compromise does not open the whole network. Segment aggressively and use continuous authentication to keep everyone honest.

### Comprehensive monitoring

Detection needs depth. Endpoint detection and response can catch misbehaviour on hosts. Network‑traffic analysis can spot odd flows. User and entity behaviour analytics can flag the strange. Memory‑protection mechanisms can stop certain classes of attack in their tracks. Layered together, they give you more than one chance to spot trouble.

## Challenges in zero-day threat modelling

Zero‑days are, by definition, unknown unknowns. Modelling them well demands time, skill, and patience. Behaviour‑based detection can produce more noise than signal. Attackers, meanwhile, are inventive creatures, happy to develop new tricks. And then there is the supply chain, where a flaw in someone else’s code can become your problem without warning.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning can, in theory, detect subtle anomalies, predict plausible attack vectors, and automate parts of the modelling process. They can also run simulations that stretch the imagination.

Runtime application self‑protection (RASP) bakes defences into the application itself, monitoring behaviour and blocking the suspicious without waiting for external instructions.

In cloud environments, cloud‑native techniques—such as scanning infrastructure‑as‑code, adopting immutable infrastructure, and enforcing policies automatically—offer ways to make entire deployment patterns more resistant to the unexpected.

## TL;DR: Surviving the unknown

Zero-day vulnerabilities are the software flaws nobody knows about—until they are exploited. Vendors have not patched them, defenders have not planned for them, and yet attackers are more than happy to take advantage. Traditional threat modelling, which leans on known vulnerabilities, is about as useful here as a map of last year’s train delays.

Instead, zero-day threat modelling requires a behaviour‑centric approach: look for weak points in architecture, watch for deviations from normal behaviour, and reduce the number of doors attackers can try. Established frameworks such as STRIDE and PASTA can be adapted for this by focusing on trust boundaries, data flows, and hypothetical exploitation paths rather than known exploits.

Key strategies include adopting an “assume breach” mindset, tightening your attack surface, and integrating threat intelligence into daily operations. Embedding this thinking into the secure development lifecycle—and coupling it with zero trust principles—helps reduce the impact of a zero‑day even if prevention fails.

The challenges are significant: unknown unknowns, false positives, and ever‑evolving attacker techniques, not to mention the fragility of supply chains. Emerging tools such as AI‑driven anomaly detection, runtime application self‑protection, and cloud‑native security patterns are promising, but they are no substitute for disciplined, continuous threat modelling.

In short: you cannot predict the unpredictable, but you can design systems that fail gracefully, detect mischief 
quickly, and recover [before the whole thing unravels]({{< relref "posts/divd.md" >}}).
