## Europe's most successful failure  

The cigarette stands as Europe's most paradoxical public health achievement - a product so lethal it would be banned instantly if invented today, yet so entrenched we've normalised its 700,000 annual deaths. That lit cigarette transforms into a miniature chemical factory producing 7,000 compounds - including 70 known carcinogens - because apparently variety isn't just life's spice, but its premature ending too.  

Tar performs its grim alchemy, transmuting healthy lungs into something resembling a Victorian industrialist's handkerchief. Carbon monoxide clings to haemoglobin with the desperation of a Brexit negotiator clinging to sovereignty fantasies, starving tissues of oxygen. Yet despite these horrors, Europe treats smoking with the resigned tolerance of a long-suffering spouse - we know it's bad, but the divorce would be so messy.  

## Vaping, the less dreadful alternative  

Enter vaping - the nicotine equivalent of switching from absinthe to shandy. The European Parliament, not known for hyperbolic statements, concedes e-cigarettes contain 90-95% fewer toxic substances than tobacco. It's the harm reduction equivalent of choosing food poisoning over botulism - not ideal, but undoubtedly preferable.  

Nicotine remains - that clingy ex who just won't take the hint - but without tobacco's supporting cast of carcinogens. The European Chemicals Agency has raised eyebrows at certain flavourings and the potential for overheating, but overall? Fewer tumours, more side-eye from strangers in parks.  

## The fox in the vape shop  

Having perfected the art of killing customers slowly, Big Tobacco now rebrands as public health crusaders. Philip Morris and British American Tobacco lobby for "responsible vaping" with the sincerity of a casino promoting responsible gambling. Their strategy? Support regulations that coincidentally crush smaller competitors while positioning their own products as the "safe" option.  

In the UK, politicians enjoy tobacco-funded "research trips" (read: all-expenses-paid holidays), while flavour bans mysteriously stall in countries where lobbying is practically an Olympic sport. It's corporate judo - using the weight of public concern to throw competitors out of the market.  

## A modern morality tale  

European teenagers have embraced vaping with the enthusiasm Americans reserve for school shootings. UK youth vaping rates have nearly doubled since 2020, proving that if there's one thing adolescents excel at, it's finding ways to horrify adults.  

The devices themselves are masterpieces of deception - disguised as USB drives, highlighters, or pieces of abstract art. Combined with flavours like "Unicorn Burst" and "Tropical Thunder," it's no wonder parents think their kids have suddenly developed an obsessive interest in computer accessories.  

Neurologists warn of nicotine's impact on developing brains - shocking precisely nobody who's met a teenager. The Royal College of Psychiatrists suggests these effects might be permanent, potentially creating a generation of adults whose attention spans make goldfish look focused.  

## Protecting kids from vaping, but not much else  

Europe mobilises against youth vaping with the urgency of a fire brigade at a match factory. Flavour bans! Advertising restrictions! Sternly worded letters! Meanwhile, actual threats to young people's futures receive polite concern at best.  

Child poverty persists across Southern and Eastern Europe. Junk food companies target kids with cartoon mascots and stadium sponsorships. TikTok serves up mental health crises faster than regulators can say "algorithmic manipulation." And housing? Many young Europeans will need either a lottery win or patrimony to ever own a home.  

But sure - let's focus on £5 vapes. That'll solve everything.  

## A guide for the perplexed European vaper  

For adults using vaping to quit smoking, navigating EU regulations requires the patience of a saint and the persistence of a telemarketer. Legal vapes can't exceed 20mg/ml nicotine - enough to take the edge off, not enough to make you start writing manifestos. Packaging must be child-resistant, because nothing says "mature adult choice" like needing pliers to open your nicotine fix.  

Environmental concerns? Disposable vapes are the plastic straws of nicotine delivery - millions discarded annually by people who'll then lecture you about recycling. France and Germany lead recycling efforts, because if there's one thing Europe loves more than bureaucracy, it's green bureaucracy.  

## A bureaucratic love story  

Europe's regulatory landscape resembles its cheese selection - diverse, confusing, and occasionally mouldy. Finland bans flavours entirely. Hungary taxes vapes like luxury cars. The Netherlands phases out anything enjoyable.  

Harmonising 27 national approaches makes herding cats look simple - especially when the cats have law degrees and strong opinions about nicotine salts. The European Respiratory Society summarises the dilemma: vaping helps smokers quit but risks creating new addicts. It's public health's version of drinking to forget you have a drinking problem.  

## EVALI: Imported outrage, domestically misapplied  

When America panicked over vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 (caused by black-market THC cartridges), Europe caught the fear like a nasty cold. Never mind that regulated nicotine vaping caused zero similar cases - nuance doesn't trend.  

Public Health England tried restoring sanity, reiterating vaping's relative safety. But between moral panic and corporate lobbying, reason never stood a chance.  

## The flavour of hypocrisy  

Europe's vaping debate reveals our collective hypocrisy. We'll ban bubblegum vape juice while tolerating systems that leave young people drowning in debt, insecure work, and unaffordable housing. We'll regulate e-liquids to the milligram while allowing social media giants to experiment on children's mental health.  

Vaping deserves scrutiny. But if we truly cared about youth welfare, we'd address all threats with equal vigour - not just the ones that come in pretty flavours.
