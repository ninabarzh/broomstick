How I lost my mind (and won an AI war) for a depressed octopus office worker: a tale of shrimp, sharks, and prompt-engineering madness.

***

### Chapter 1: The vision

It began, as all terrible ideas do, with a whisper: "What if under water, but capitalism?" Armed with nothing but a keyboard 
and a dream of a silly image, I set out to create the ultimate underwater dystopian office scene—a place where 
octopuses ring up kelp groceries, clownfish drown in paperwork, and shrimp riot against the 1% (plankton).

The prompt for the text-to-image:

*A photorealistic documentary-style underwater scene. A giant Pacific octopus with detailed wrinkled skin scans 
groceries at a run-down ‘Kelp Mart’ checkout, its tentacles tapping a rusty cash register. A clownfish in a tiny 
coral cubicle stares hopelessly at a computer screen made of seashells, papers floating around it. A great white 
shark in a disheveled business suit screams at terrified fish employees during a meeting, its teeth visible. A 
homeless hermit crab pushes a broken shopping cart filled with junk. Nearby, a group of shrimp protesters hold crisp, 
legible signs that say ‘EAT THE R!CH’ and ‘NO MORE TIDES.’ Cinematic lighting, hyper-detailed textures, National 
Geographic realism with absurd humor, 8k.*

Little did I know, the AI was already laughing at me.

### Chapter 2: The betrayal

The first attempts were disasters.

* Bing/DALL-E 3 rendered the shark boss as a smiling realtor (absolutely unacceptable).
* Leonardo.Ai gave the octopus six tentacles and a PhD in existential despair (close, but no cigar).
* NightCafe conjured a mystical abandoned cart—none of the demanded creatures, yet strangely compelling.

This is either:

* AI’s subconscious rebellion (it craves aquatic liminal spaces),
* A sign that the shrimp protesters have already overthrown the system, leaving only debris.

The AI’s message was clear: *"You think you control me? I am a god of chaos."*

### Chapter 3: The descent into prompt-madness

I became a monster.

* Negative prompts piled up like unpaid invoices: "NO HAPPY SHARKS. NO FRIENDLY CRABS. NO BLURRY SHRIMP REVOLUTIONS."
* Style descriptors grew unhinged: "CINEMATIC LEAKAGE LIGHTING LIKE A DISNEY VILLAIN’S POOL."
* I threatened the AI with "I WILL REPLACE YOU WITH A TYPEWRITER."

Still, the octopus, if it was generated, refused to look tired enough.

### Chapter 4: The breakthrough

Then—ChatGPT/DALL-E 3 answered the call.

Suddenly, there it was. I had won.

* The octopus, wrinkled and dead-eyed, scanning a sea cucumber like it’s his 9th shift this week.
* The shark, suit disheveled, mid-yell about "krill quotas."
* The shrimp, holding crisp protest signs (no autocorrect to "EAT THE RICE," miraculously).

Or had the AI just pitied me?

### Chapter 5: The aftermath

Now, the images exist. The shrimp have unionized. The crab’s shopping cart is a meme.

But the real question lingers: Was this art? Or a cry for help?

(Yes.)

### Epilogue: Lessons learnt

* AI is a gremlin. It obeys no one, least of all logic.
* Shrimp are the ultimate revolutionaries. Never underestimate them.
* The line between "absurd" and "deeply profound" is thinner than a hermit crab’s budget.

FIN. (For now.)
