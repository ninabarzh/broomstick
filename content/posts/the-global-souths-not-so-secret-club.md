The BRICS alliance began life as something between a Goldman Sachs marketing gimmick and a drunken bet among emerging 
market traders. "I'll wager you a case of champagne these four economies will dominate by 2050!" Fast-forward two 
decades, and what started as an investment banker's acronym has somehow morphed into a geopolitical bloc with 
expansionist ambitions. The recent addition of six new members - including such bastions of liberal democracy as 
Iran and Saudi Arabia - under the "BRICS+" banner suggests this is no longer just about economics. This is about 
building an alternative world order where the rules are made by autocrats, petrostates, and at least one country 
(India) that can't decide whether it wants to join the party or call the police to shut it down.

## A history of mild ambition

The story begins in 2001 when Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs, presumably while staring at a spreadsheet after his 
third espresso, coined the term "BRIC" to describe the four economies he believed would reshape global capitalism. 
For years, it remained little more than a handy label for fund managers looking to justify their emerging market bets. 
Then came the 2008 financial crisis, which provided the perfect catalyst for these nations to discover their shared 
victimhood. "Why should the West get to break the global economy and still run all the institutions?" they asked, 
while conveniently ignoring their own domestic financial skeletons.

The first formal BRIC summit in 2009 was less a meeting of minds and more a gathering of countries united by what 
they opposed (American hegemony) rather than what they supported (any coherent alternative). South Africa's inclusion 
in 2010, transforming BRIC into BRICS, was the geopolitical equivalent of adding a fifth wheel to a car that wasn't 
sure where it was driving anyway. But with characteristic emerging market optimism, they pressed on, creating 
institutions like the New Development Bank - essentially a World Bank tribute act with slightly worse lending terms.

## Accepting questionable members

The 2024 expansion saw the arrival of six new members, each bringing their own baggage to the party. Saudi Arabia and 
the UAE arrived like wealthy socialites hedging their bets between West and East. Iran turned up wearing sunglasses 
indoors and asking if anyone had change for a sanctions-busting oil shipment. Egypt and Ethiopia came hoping someone 
might finally pay attention to Africa, while Argentina - perpetually on the verge of another economic crisis - 
seemed to have wandered in by accident looking for the IMF meeting next door.

The price of admission to this exclusive club? A willingness to at least pretend you're interested in 
"de-dollarisation" (while quietly maintaining your US Treasury holdings), a tolerance for photo ops with Vladimir 
Putin, and the ability to keep a straight face when China talks about "win-win cooperation." For Europe, watching 
traditionally Western-aligned states like Saudi Arabia and the UAE flirt with BRICS+ must feel like seeing your 
dependable local pub start hosting meetings of the Flat Earth Society - disconcerting, but not yet catastrophic.

## The BRICS to-do list

The BRICS wishlist reads like a teenager's letter to Santa after they've just discovered anti-capitalist literature. 
A common currency! An alternative to SWIFT! An end to Western dominance! The reality, as any sober economist will 
tell you, is somewhat different. The New Development Bank has disbursed about $30 billion in loans since 2015 - 
roughly what the World Bank lends in a slow quarter. Their much-vaunted "BRICS Pay" system remains in perpetual 
pilot mode, like a municipal bus route that's always "coming soon." As for the proposed BRICS currency, this is 
the financial equivalent of announcing plans to build a space elevator - technically possible, but requiring a 
level of coordination these nations have yet to demonstrate on even basic trade agreements.

Where BRICS+ does have real clout is in energy markets. Between Russia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Iran, the expanded 
bloc now controls over 40% of global oil production. This gives them considerable leverage, though whether they can 
coordinate this power remains doubtful. Watching Saudi Arabia and Iran agree on oil production quotas is like 
watching two rival football firms try to organize a charity bake sale - the potential for disaster is ever-present.

## Too Good to Be True?

For all its grand ambitions, BRICS resembles nothing so much as a group project where none of the members 
particularly like each other. China and India continue their Himalayan staring contest while pretending to be 
economic partners. Brazil periodically remembers it's actually a Western-aligned democracy and gets cold feet. 
South Africa struggles to explain why it's even there. And Russia, increasingly a geopolitical pariah, clings to 
BRICS like a drunk to a lamppost - it's not taking him anywhere useful, but it's better than lying in the gutter.

The institutional weaknesses are glaring. Unlike the EU, which at least attempts to pretend it has common policies, 
BRICS operates on a principle of "agree to disagree... and then issue a vague joint statement." The New Development 
Bank's insistence on equal voting rights sounds noble until you realize it means a €17 trillion economy (China) 
gets the same say as a €400 billion one (South Africa). It's the equivalent of giving every member of a football 
team equal playing time regardless of ability - heartwarming in theory, disastrous in practice.

## Future scenarios for BRICS+  

The BRICS+ alliance is at a crossroads, balancing between lofty ambitions and geopolitical realities. Its future 
trajectory will shape not just its member states but the entire global order—whether as a paper tiger, an economic 
powerhouse, an anti-Western bloc, or a fractured coalition. Exploring each scenario’s likelihood, mechanics, 
and global ripple effects, from trade wars to currency battles.  

---

### The ‘United Nations 2.0’ scenario 

Likelihood: High 

Mechanics:  
- BRICS+ summits devolve into diplomatic theater, producing grand declarations (e.g., "multipolar world order") but little action.  
- The New Development Bank (NDB) remains a minor player, approving modest loans ($39B total since 2015) while members still rely on Western financial systems.  
- Trade within BRICS+ stagnates at ~6.5% of members’ total trade, as logistical hurdles (e.g., no direct flights between most capitals) persist.  

Global impact:  
- Symbolic wins, no systemic change. The dollar stays dominant, and Western sanctions retain their bite.  
- Europe breathes easy: No threat to EU trade or financial systems. Brussels may even chuckle at the bloc’s dysfunction.  
- Developing world disillusionment: Countries like Ethiopia or Argentina, which joined for economic alternatives, see few tangible benefits.  

Wildcard: A major crisis (e.g., Russia’s collapse) could force BRICS+ to act—or implode.  

---

### The ‘Economic Bloc That Actually Works’ scenario  

Likelihood: Low but plausible  

Mechanics:  
- NDB evolves into a true World Bank rival, leveraging its AA+ credit rating to fund mega-projects (e.g., transcontinental railways).  
- BRICS Pay gains traction, enabling local-currency transactions and denting SWIFT’s monopoly (though dollar conversions persist).  
- Oil producers (Saudi, UAE, Iran) price crude in yuan/rupees, chipping away at petrodollar hegemony.  

Global impact:  
- Dollar erosion: The greenback remains top, but BRICS+ currencies carve out 15–20% of global trade.  
- Europe’s dilemma: Forced to engage with BRICS+ financial tools while protecting euro stability. German exporters cheer cheaper yuan deals; French bankers panic.  
- Global South shift: African/Latin American nations pivot trade to BRICS+, demanding concessions from the West.  

Obstacles:  
- China-India rivalry: Beijing’s dominance (e.g., via digital yuan) spooks New Delhi.  
- US countermeasures: Trump’s threatened "150% tariffs" on BRICS+ trade could spark a financial cold war.  

---

### The ‘Anti-West Alliance’ scenario  

Likelihood: Very low

Mechanics:  
- Common BRICS+ currency launched, backed by gold/oil reserves—a "dragon-ruble-riyal" frankenstein.  
- Joint security pact formed (Russia sells S-400s to Iran; China builds bases in Africa).  
- Coordinated UN voting to block Western resolutions (e.g., on Ukraine, Taiwan).  

Global impact:  
- Financial Armageddon: The Fed/EU retaliate with capital controls. Bitcoin soars as everyone hedges.  
- Europe’s energy crisis 2.0: Russia-Saudi-Iran oil cartel squeezes EU via production cuts.  
- Global fracture: WTO collapses into BRICS vs. G7 trade blocs. Neutral states (e.g., Indonesia) profit as swing players.  

Why It’s Unlikely:  
- Ideological incompatibility: Sunni UAE won’t share intel with Shia Iran. Democratic India won’t back Putin’s wars.  
- China’s caution: Beijing prefers economic infiltration (Belt and Road) over open confrontation.  

---

### The ‘Messy Divorce’ scenario

Likelihood: Moderate 

Mechanics:  
- India exits, citing China’s "debt-trap diplomacy" and joins US-led Chip 4 alliance.  
- Brazil swings right, electing a pro-US leader who calls BRICS+ "a CCP puppet show".  
- Rump BRICS (China, Russia, Iran) becomes a pariah bloc, reliant on forced yuan trade and North Korean IT support.  

Global impact:  
- Short-term chaos: Markets panic as BRICS Pay collapses; oil prices swing wildly.  
- Europe’s opportunity: Exploits the split to lure India/Saudi into EU trade pacts.  
- China’s isolation deepens: Forced to double down on Belt and Road—or risk irrelevance.  

Trigger Events:  
- India-China border clash (again).  
- US offers Brazil NATO "partner" status.  

---

### The ripple effects for Europe  

Europe’s fate hinges on which scenario unfolds:  

1. If BRICS+ fizzles (first or last scenario):  
   - Business as usual. EU maintains dollar-centric trade, though Germany may push for more yuan flexibility.  
   - Energy security improves as Russia’s influence wanes.  

2. If BRICS+ succeeds (other scenarios):  
   - Euro under pressure as yuan gains reserve status. ECB scrambles to defend monetary sovereignty.  
   - Sanctions become toothless: EU can no longer isolate Iran/Russia without economic blowback.  
   - Tech decoupling: Forced to choose between US semiconductors and Chinese 5G—a lose-lose.  

Wildcard: A "BRICS-EU détente" where Brussels brokers deals with factions (e.g., India+South Africa vs. China+Russia).

## Conclusion: BRICS+ is a weathervane, not a hurricane  

The bloc’s real power lies in its potential to disrupt, not its current coherence. Even in its weakest form 
([first scenario](#the-united-nations-20-scenario)), it erodes Western unipolarity. In its strongest 
([third scenario](#the-anti-west-alliance-scenario)), it could rewrite global rules—though 
that remains fantasy for now.  

Europe’s best play? Divide and engage. Court democratic BRICS+ members (India, Brazil) while containing China’s 
ambitions. And maybe—just maybe—stockpile some gold.
