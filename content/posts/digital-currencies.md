Digital currencies promise a brave new world of financial innovation. But let us not get carried away with the 
techno-optimism. These things are not just magic internet money, they come with a tangled web of risks, from 
eye-watering scams to dystopian surveillance features. Especially when central banks start sniffing around with 
programmable money and “policy precision”.  

Beneath the glossy marketing and breathless whitepapers lies a simple truth: digital currencies, while technically 
clever, may be socially and economically catastrophic if adopted blindly. This is about governments reengineering the 
monetary system with a fine-toothed comb and far too much enthusiasm.  

A breakdown of what could possibly go wrong.

## Dangers of digital currencies  

### Lack of legal protections and irreversible transactions  

With your bank, if something goes wrong, say, you pay the wrong person or someone pinches your card, there is at 
least the faint hope of recourse. You ring a hotline, fill out a form, and maybe, just maybe, get your money back. In 
crypto, however, there is no hotline. There is no desk. There is no human. There is just a cold, indifferent 
blockchain telling you: “tough luck.”  

Every transaction is final. Accidentally sent your life savings to a scammer? That is a you problem now. Your 
best bet is to tweet about it and hope the internet takes pity. Meanwhile, fraud has become endemic. In 2024 
alone, crypto scammers ran off with \$12.4 billion (€11.4 billion). That is billion, with a “b.” The scams are 
getting cleverer, too: fake influencers, AI-generated girlfriend-boyfriend combos, investment platforms with slick 
interfaces and zero actual assets. The promise of decentralisation has unfortunately extended to accountability, there 
is none.  

### Extreme volatility and investment risks  

Crypto markets make traditional financial markets look positively sedate. The value of a coin can jump 30% in a day 
based on a tweet, a rumour, or Elon Musk deciding he is bored again. It is a volatile mess dressed up as “disruption.” 
Behind the memes and moon emojis lies a brutal truth: this is not an investment; it is speculation on speed.  

And then there is trading, the financial equivalent of juggling chainsaws while on fire. People borrow 
huge sums to bet on price movements, often with catastrophic results. When the market moves (which it always does), 
it does not just eat your investment. It devours your margin, your optimism, and anything else not nailed down. 
We now have entire subcultures dedicated to coping with the emotional wreckage.  

### Security vulnerabilities and cyber risks  

The crypto space is a treasure trove for hackers. With no central oversight and billions sloshing around in 
digital wallets, it is a target-rich environment for every cybercriminal from bedroom teenager to North Korean cyber 
unit. Phishing attacks, malware, exchange hacks, it is all on the menu. Once your wallet is emptied, there is no 
magical undo button. You are out of luck and likely out of rent.  

Even the so-called “safer” side of the ecosystem, stablecoins, has proven anything but. These are digital tokens 
supposedly pegged to real-world currencies like the dollar. But that peg can wobble or snap entirely. When TerraUSD 
collapsed in 2022, \$18 billion went up in digital smoke. In 2023, a hiccup in the banking system saw USDC 
temporarily depeg. And unlike actual bank deposits, these things are not insured. You lose, you lose.  

### Privacy concerns and surveillance risks  

Crypto was supposed to liberate us from surveillance capitalism, but it turns out most of it is about as private as 
shouting your bank balance in the middle of the supermarket. Public blockchains record every transaction. Forever. 
Anyone with time, motivation, or decent forensic software can trace your financial activity right back to you, 
especially if you have ever linked your wallet to a centralised exchange.  

CBDCs take the surveillance game to a whole new level. Imagine a system where every transaction you make is visible 
to the central bank. Not just the big purchases, but the coffees, the subscriptions, the late-night kebabs. All 
recorded, all analysable, all potentially weaponised. This is not just financial infrastructure, it is the 
architecture for behavioural control. And once it is in place, you do not get to opt out.  

### Financial system instability  

Digital currencies are not just disruptive in a hip Silicon Valley way, they threaten to destabilise the financial 
system itself. If people start pulling deposits out of banks en masse and plonking them into CBDC wallets or 
stablecoins, banks lose access to the cheap, stable funding that underpins their lending. Less money in, less money 
out. Cue credit crunch.  

In some parts of the world, especially where local currencies are about as stable as a soggy stool, foreign-backed 
stablecoins are already gaining traction. Sounds helpful, until you realise it means surrendering monetary policy 
to another country. That is not financial liberation. That is economic colonisation via blockchain.

## Expanded powers of central banks with CBDCs  

### Direct control over money supply  

CBDCs let central banks bypass commercial banks and interact directly with the public. Great for financial efficiency. 
Less great for checks and balances. When central banks have direct control over the digital cash in your pocket (or 
app), they can tweak the economy with a surgical precision previously reserved for science fiction.  

Want to inject stimulus? No problem. Want to apply negative interest rates directly to consumer wallets? Also not 
a problem. What used to take years of policy nudges could be done with a few lines of code. It is all very exciting 
until someone with terrible judgement gets hold of the controls, or worse, someone with *excellent* judgement and no 
accountability.  

### Improved surveillance and policy enforcement  

The public narrative is all about preventing crime, catching tax cheats, and protecting us from economic bad actors. 
But let us not be naïve. CBDCs make it possible to track every transaction in real time. Governments can trace who 
gave money to what, when, and why. That kind of power is tempting, and once installed, rarely scaled back.  

And then there is programmable money. It is not science fiction, it is in the design docs. Money that expires. Money 
that only works in certain shops. Money that shuts off if your carbon footprint’s too high. Sounds like dystopia? 
That is because it is. When your money starts making decisions for you, we have passed the point of financial 
autonomy and entered the era of algorithmic paternalism.  

### Lender of last resort for digital finance  

In a CBDC world, central banks could respond to crises by injecting funds directly into citizens' wallets. No 
middlemen, no delay. On the surface, this looks like resilience. But over time, it breeds dependency. Why bother 
fixing structural economic issues when the digital helicopter money will always arrive?  

We have already seen the political headache of pandemic-era stimulus. Now imagine a world where those payments can 
be fine-tuned to political loyalty or consumer behaviour. It starts with good intentions. It ends with money as a 
behavioural nudge. Welcome to central banking, rebranded as social engineering.  

### Influence over financial inclusion (or exclusion)  

CBDCs have been marketed as a tool for inclusion, giving digital wallets to people who have been left out of the 
traditional banking system. Sounds good. But this utopia is full of caveats. Without a smartphone, a data plan, or 
the right documents, many will still be locked out. The same systemic exclusion, now on shinier infrastructure.  

And worse, inclusion can flip to exclusion with a policy update. A flagged account. A missed ID verification. 
Suddenly, your CBDC wallet freezes, and you are back to bartering biscuits. We have seen this with traditional 
financial institutions; CBDCs just make it faster and harder to contest.  

### Global monetary competition  

The world is not waiting. China has already launched its digital yuan and is rolling it out with purpose. The EU and 
US are scrambling to catch up, each viewing CBDCs as geopolitical tools. It is not just about domestic efficiency, it 
is about power projection. The currency that dominates international trade in the digital age will carry influence 
beyond economics.  

If multiple CBDCs start vying for supremacy, we are not looking at a smooth transition to a globalised future. We 
are looking at monetary Balkanisation, with capital controls, cyber attacks, and economic nationalism baked into the 
system. The 21st-century currency wars will not be fought with guns, they will be fought with code, consent, and 
coercion.

Digital currencies are not toys, trends, or tech upgrades. They are instruments of economic change, and, 
potentially, control. Cryptocurrencies have already shown us the chaos that emerges when financial systems are 
unmoored from regulation, law, and reason. CBDCs threaten to bring order to that chaos, but the kind of order you 
get in a high-security prison.  

This is about more than money. It is about autonomy, transparency, and the future of civil liberties in a digitised 
economy. Yes, innovation matters. But not if it leads us down a path where every pound/euro/dollar/currency is tracked, 
every transaction controlled, and every citizen treated like a node in a machine. Proceed with caution. And maybe keep 
a few coins in the mattress, just in case the algorithm decides you have misbehaved.
