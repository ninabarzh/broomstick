You’d think something called the General Data Protection Regulation might actually protect data. You’d be wrong. Along with its elder cousin, the ICCPR, GDPR was hailed as the Great Hope™—a beacon of digital dignity in a world run by surveillance capitalists. But instead of taming the beast, it handed it a clipboard and told it to tick some boxes.

The GDPR officially kicked in at the stroke of midnight on 25 May 2018, like some sort of data privacy Cinderella. It was meant to give users the sacred gift of choice—to say yes or no to having their personal lives vacuumed up, analysed, monetised, and passed around like cheap party favours. What we actually got was an avalanche of “consent” banners and passive-aggressive pop-ups saying: “Agree or get lost.”

On day one, the fine folks at [noyb.eu](https://noyb.eu/) (None Of Your Business, in case you missed the joke) filed complaints against Google, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram for what they rightly called “forced consent”. Because let’s be honest—when “agreeing” is the only way to access the service, it’s not consent. It’s coercion, wrapped in legalese.

## Meanwhile, in Politics...

The grown-ups in charge appear utterly out of their depth. They’re flailing in the face of six colossal issues:

* the slow-motion car crash that is environmental destruction, 
* the digitisation of absolutely everything, 
* unaccountable algorithms pulling levers behind the curtain, 
* political discourse that makes Orwell look quaint, 
* a globalisation model written by and for sociopaths, 
* and a steady erosion of the rule of law, dressed up as “reform”. 

We want to breathe clean air and drink clean water, not microplastics. We want to use the internet without being stalked by ads for things we never mentioned aloud. We’d quite like artificial intelligence that isn’t making life-or-death decisions like some deranged sorting hat. We’d prefer politicians to tell the truth now and then, instead of spinning reality like DJ decks. And we’re really not loving the idea of buying clothes made by unpaid children in collapsing factories.

The trouble is, Europe’s current constitutions are about as helpful as a fax machine in a blackout.

## Introducing: Six New Fundamental Rights

So, what if we rewrote the script? No more tinkering around the edges. Let’s have a proper constitutional reboot. Here’s what the Charter of Fundamental Rights should say in 2025:

### Article 1 – Environment

Everyone has the right to live in an environment that is healthy, protected, and preferably not on fire.

### Article 2 – Digital Self-Determination

Everyone has the right to control their digital identity. No more profiling, no more manipulation. Ads that follow you around the internet should be classified as stalking.

### Article 3 – Artificial Intelligence

Everyone has the right to know what algorithms are doing to them. They should be transparent, accountable, and not treated like sorcery. Big decisions must involve a human being—preferably one who isn’t asleep at the wheel.

### Article 4 – Truth

Everyone has the right to expect that people in power occasionally tell the truth. Lies should come with a health warning, like cigarettes.

### Article 5 – Globalisation

Everyone has the right to buy things that weren’t made in violation of basic decency. No forced labour. No ecological ruin. No “fast fashion” that unravels in the wash.

### Article 6 – Fundamental Rights Lawsuits

Everyone has the right to sue the trousers off institutions that systematically trample their rights. The European Courts should be open for business—and not just to lobbyists.

### Sign the Demand

It’s time to stop pretending the current system is working. If the law can’t keep up with the times, it’s time to change the law. [Sign to demand Six New Fundamental Rights](https://you.wemove.eu/campaigns/for-new-fundamental-rights-in-europe). Because box-ticking is not the same as freedom—and we're not consenting to this nonsense any more.
