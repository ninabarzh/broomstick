## About the Broomstick

Welcome to *The Broomstick Brief*—a blog for those who suspect that the world isn’t quite as rational, peaceful, or 
democratic as advertised.

This is a space for untangling complexity, lifting the curtain on technocratic waffle, and occasionally poking polite 
fun at the collapsing scaffolding of late-stage capitalism. Here you’ll find long-form analysis, speculative scenarios, 
and the odd broom closet of critical thought—sweeping through the mess of geopolitics, information warfare, climate 
collapse, digital security, and the bureaucratic inertia that enables it all.

I take Europe seriously enough to critique it, and power seriously enough to mock it. From BRICS+ fantasies to 
flotilla voyages, economic sieges to surveillance sleight-of-hand, each post aims to shift the Overton window ever 
so slightly off its hinges.

This is not a blog for the faint of heart, nor for those seeking five-point solutions to two-thousand-year+ old problems. 
But if you're partial to threads of resistance hidden in footnotes, the politics of infrastructure and broken links, 
or the occasional ASCII diagram of societal decay—Then you’re in the right place.

### Who’s behind the broom?

A systems tinkerer, threat modeller, and critical educator with a habit of tracing multi-root causes where others would 
rather prune symptoms. More comfortable on the command line than on a podium, but willing to write the things that 
ought to be said—especially when they’re inconvenient.

For 20 years I have had ample time to research things (curiosity and the drive for grounding 
always makes time), and hardly had time for writing. Now that I have returned home, I seem to be exploding in bottled 
up rants.

All views are the author's own. Which is to say: fiercely independent, fact-grounded, and allergic to buzzwords 
unless used ironically.
